							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
							
								<p>Useful guidelines in investing are rarer than people think. Most investors&mdash;and we're talking about pros, even at the top Wall Street firms&mdash;are decidedly un-methodical, relying on a fluid combination of exhaustive research and intuition to pick stocks.</p>
	
								<p>In Finding the Next Starbucks, GSV founder Michael Moe introduced his Four Ps framework to simplify the process of identifying the stars of tomorrow. Among a sea of research, opinion, tools, and historical data, he boiled down the essential characteristics that enable him to zero in on the small companies that are most likely to become big companies.</p>
							
								<h3 class="gsv-tabset-content-col-heading">Moe's Four Ps are: People, Product, Potential, and Predictability.</h3>
							
							</div>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
	
								<p>At its most fundamental level, a growth company is a business that is increasing its sales and earnings at a much higher rate than the average company. Over time there is nearly a 100% correlation between a company's earnings growth and its stock performance. Yet much more goes into reliably identifying emerging companies that will consistently outperform their peers.</p>
	
								<p>The Four Ps takes this vast, complex, and high stakes discipline and makes it clear and repeatable.</p>
	
								<p>We believe this tool is particularly useful because it not only helps us identify the greatest opportunities for substantial growth, but it also balances reward with associated risk. We view risk as measuring the potential for permanent capital loss, not short-term quotational loss, and we assess its probability against what we think the value of a business will be in the future in order to make the smartest bets.</p>

							<h2 class="gsv-tabset-content-heading">People</h2>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
							
								<p>The most important of the Four Ps, the <strong>people</strong> running a company represent more than half of its value. When it comes to recognizing tomorrow's big market winners, there's no shortage of interesting ideas, but it's the quality of the leadership team that usually determines the level and pace of success.</p>
	
								<p>Winners find a way to win. The goal is always to find a great leader at the head of a great team. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to tell the exceptional from the mediocre. It takes of lot of leg work. Many well positioned growth companies don't have long histories, but their people usually do.</p>
							
							</div>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
								
								<p>Over the years, we've compiled a deep arsenal of telltale questions&mdash;about experience and reputation, long-term vision, employee turnover and developing talent, hiring and compensation philosophies, management equity, short- versus long-term focus, strategic strength, how the competition is viewed, and so on. A wide range of key considerations combine to form one critical, over-arching indicator.</p>
	
								<p>Once a team establishes that it has the bright future that growth investors seek, evaluating how management executes against its promises and opportunities over time is the biggest key to finding the megawinners.</p>

							<h2 class="gsv-tabset-content-heading">Product</h2>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
							
								<p>The best opportunities can be found with companies that are the best at what they do. What's their claim to fame?</p>

								<p>Bet on innovators, not imitators. We avoid "me too" companies because they may survive, but they rarely thrive.</p>

								<p>Companies that dominate a niche own the pole position. But the smaller ones that offer better <strong>products</strong> (along with higher and more sustainable margins, or stronger and more visible growth) can overtake the leaders. They're the stars of tomorrow.</p>

								<p>The best scenario is a one-of-a-kind company, because they have no real competition. Apple, eBay, Facebook...they don't face the same obstacles that most companies must overcome.</p>
							
							</div>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
								
								<p>For most businesses, they key to examine is market share. What is it, and is it trending up or down? The stars of tomorrow will not only gain market share; they'll do it profitably.</p>

								<p>On the service side, we use three key metrics to single out the stars: revenue per employee, recurring revenue from existing customers, and elective employee turnover. The caliber of the sales force, as well as the size of R&D budgets, are also useful indicators.</p>

								<p>Like world-class management, it's hard to find companies with truly great or unique products. But it's nearly impossible to achieve superstar growth without delivering something that can lead to disproportionate gain relative to the competition.</p>

							<h2 class="gsv-tabset-content-heading">Potential</h2>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
							
								<p>When small companies grow into large companies, investors enjoy sizable returns. Our strategy is focused on where this is most likely to occur.</p>

								<p>We look for large addressable markets or nascent growth opportunities with open-ended growth. And we search for problems and pain in the marketplace.</p>

								<p>"Megatrends" are forces that drive change, productivity, and ultimately growth throughout the economy. The Internet, globalization, consolidation, and outsourcing are a few examples. They're catalysts for growing markets, influencing consumer behavior and business processes, and serving as building blocks for new products and services.</p>
							
							</div>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
								
								<p>Megatrends create tailwinds of opportunity, influencing how large a market can become and how quickly. Where they intersect with the growth sectors of the economy&mdash;technology, healthcare, media, education, and business and consumer services&mdash;represent the greatest <strong>potential</strong>, and the best places to focus energy and resources.</p>

								<p>Just as importantly, "negatrends" are societal shifts that contribute to shrinking market opportunity. Realities like unskilled workers and middlemen can derail even the best management teams and product offerings. Even category leaders that continue to gain market share are unattractive if the pie is getting smaller.</p>

								<p>A market doesn't have to be big today (or even exist yet) to have enormous potential. But a star of tomorrow absolutely must operate in a space that has significant upside.</p>

						<div id="gsv-tabset-predictability" role="tabpanel" aria-labeledby="gsv-tabset-predictability-tab" aria-hidden="true" class="gsv-tabset-content clearfix">
						
							<h2 class="gsv-tabset-content-heading">Predictability</h2>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
							
								<p>If the other Ps check out, we need to assess the visibility of a company's growth. Are there recurring revenues or a formula that produces predictable returns?</p>

								<p>The best growth companies have high predictability and gain operating leverage as they continue to achieve economies of scale. This is often a major challenge for young, fast-growing businesses. That's in part why the stars of tomorrow are so few and far between&mdash;and why they usually reap the benefit of premium valuations.</p>

								<p>Predictability is a relative term. Some industries and business models are much more predictable than others. A contract-based service provider model, for example, tends to enjoy greater consistency than a retailer of discretionary consumer products. So it's critical for investors to gauge the fourth P in a way that's appropriate for each industry.</p>
							
							</div>
							
							<div class="gsv-tabset-content-col">
								
								<p>The holy grail of predictable, visible growth is recurring revenues. Companies that leverage consistent, ongoing customer relationships and the perpetual nature of the associated revenue streams almost always have big premiums to their multiples.</p>

								<p>Of course, accurately forecasting a company's ability to perform against expectations is not only tied to the business model; it's also a function of the first three Ps: people, product, and potential. Each distinct element of the Four Ps framework is vital, but the integrated whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
